# Asynchronous Greedy Surrogate Client

This repository provides the code base for a greedy, asynchronous surrogate model in the form of an UM-[UM-Bridge](https://um-bridge-benchmarks.readthedocs.io/en/docs/) server. The interface can be used for different surrogate types, but the current applications really on *Gaussian Process Regression* as implemented in the [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.gaussian_process.GaussianProcessRegressor.html) library. The basic idea of the implementation is that a surrogate can learn an input-output mapping from another model, from which it fetches new training data on demand. This demand is determined by the variance in the (probabilistic) surrogate prediction for a given input. If the variance is below a user-defined threshold, the surrogate prediction is returned. Otherwise, a new run of the data-generating model is triggered and its output is returned. In addition, the newly generated data is used to retrain the surrogate in an asynchronous background process.
The described approach is particularly useful for multilevel-type algorithms. We have successfully employed it for a specialized version of the *Multilevel Delayed Acceptance* (MLDA) algorithm, a multilevel Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler. For further details, we refer the reader to the accompanying publication, "Scalable Bayesian Inference of Large Simulations via Asynchronous Prefetching Multilevel Delayed Acceptance".

## Installation

The library in this repository is a Python package readily installable via `pip`, simply run
```python
pip install .
```
in the root directory. Alternatively, you may use [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), which has been used for the setup of the project.

## Usage

The `surrogate` package comprises to main components, `SurrogateControl` in the `surrogate_control` module, and a hierarchy of actual surrogate models in `surrogate_model`. In the latter module `BaseSurrogateModel` provides a generic interface compatible with the control. The `SKLearnGPSurrogateModel` class is the implementation of that interface based on `sckit-learn`. Other implementations are possible analogously. The `SurrogateControl` takes a `BaseSurrogateModel` instance along with another callable to generate "true" outputs. We will refer to this as `simulation_model`. As an UM-Bridge server, the surrogate control can receive requests for evaluation for some input parameter set. These calls are dispatched to the prediction of the surrogate or the simulation model, depending on the variance criterion mentioned above. The control further has a daemon process running in the background. Whenever new training data becomes available through simulation model runs, that background process scrapes the data and retrains the surrogate.
